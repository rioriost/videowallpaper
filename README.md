# VideoWallpaper

VideoWallpaper is a lightweight macOS menu bar app that lets you play a video as your desktop wallpaper.

## Features

- Plays a video behind your desktop icons
- Works across multiple displays
- Shares one playback pipeline across displays to avoid duplicate decoding
- Loops the selected video automatically
- Lives in the menu bar for quick access
- Lets you change the video at any time
- Starts automatically when you log in
- Skips audible playback and pauses when the display sleeps or another app covers the screen
- Warns when the selected video may be inefficient for wallpaper playback

## Requirements

- macOS 15 or later

## Install

Install with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install --cask rioriost/cask/videowallpaper
```

## How to use

1. Launch `VideoWallpaper`.
2. When prompted, choose a video file from your Mac.
3. The selected video will start playing as your wallpaper.
4. To change the video later, click the menu bar icon and choose `Change Video...`.
5. To quit the app, click the menu bar icon and choose `Quit`.

## Notes

- Your selected video is remembered for the next launch.
- If your display configuration changes, the app reloads the video for the current screens.
- Mouse clicks pass through the wallpaper layer, so you can use your desktop normally.
- Videos are rendered through AVFoundation and are best used in hardware-accelerated formats such as H.264 or HEVC.
- Very high-resolution videos may be downscaled by the display but still cost extra decode power.

## Profiling

Use Xcode Instruments Time Profiler to confirm CPU usage. A healthy run should spend most time in AVFoundation/CoreMedia system threads with little self time in `VideoWallpaper`; compare one display versus multiple displays to verify the shared playback pipeline. If CPU time is already low, use Energy Log or GPU/Metal profiling before considering a custom renderer.
